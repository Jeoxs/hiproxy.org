## Contributing

Welcome to help hiproxy write and translate the documentation.

## Steps for Contributing

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy.org/issues) and tell us which chapter of the documentation you want to translate or optimization.
2. Create your own [fork](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy.org) on github, then checkout your fork.
3. Write your code in your local copy. It's good practice to create a branch based off the master branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
4. When you finish. You can submit a PR.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements. And when your code is merged We'll generate the documentation site <http://hiproxy.org/>

Thank you for contributing!
